This sample set was produced for use in Hauptwerk software version 2.0,

Most of the samples for this organ were taken from the 1966 Schantz
organ in the First Baptist Church of Riverside, California.  The remaining
stops were taken from other venues (which must remain confidential due to
agreements with those entities.)
